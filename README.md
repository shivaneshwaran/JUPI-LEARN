# JUPI-LEARN


JUPI-LEARNING is not just another e-learning platform; it's a visionary project conceived and developed by S Shivaneshwaran, our esteemed CEO, and his talented team of developers. As the founder, S Shivaneshwaran envisioned a platform where cutting-edge AI technology meets the inquisitive minds of young learners, transforming the way children engage with educational content. Together with Mohammad Fazil, Rohan Stephen and Devanandha, our R&D experts, we've created a platform that empowers young learners worldwide. At JUPI-LEARNING, our mission is simple: to empower young learners by providing them with an immersive, personalized learning experience tailored to their unique needs and interests. Our platform harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to teach children as young as five years old, making learning fun, interactive, and accessible anytime, anywhere. But our commitment to excellence doesn't stop there. We understand the importance of accuracy and accountability in education. That's why we've developed a sophisticated AI-powered system that meticulously checks the content created by our teaching AI, ensuring that the information delivered to our young learners is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date. With JUPI-LEARNING, the possibilities are endless. Whether your child is exploring the fundamentals of mathematics, unraveling the mysteries of science, or embarking on a journey through literature and language, our platform provides the tools and resources they need to succeed in the digital age. Join us on this transformative journey as we redefine education, inspire curiosity, and unlock the potential of every child, one lesson at a time.

To Whom it may concern,

We've recently noticed the cloning of our platform which was performed in violation of our license. Legal action will be taken against the website and the community misusing the FOSS club name which is also a thing to concern cuz We support FOSS in a ethical way if you want to make an open source version of our code it should be done legally since the repo is open but we have restrictions for modifying code without authorisation and also for not giving Credits for the real creators it's priracy FOSS is against piracy #stoppriracy 

Our mission is to provide free education for all the students 

JupiLearning will always provide The education for Free it's a promise from our side 

Since our version 2 is on final stage we are planing to release the version one open source with Terms and Conditions

#freeeducationforeveryone #jaihind #wearessetians 


**update**: since the illegaly cloned site has officially declared themselves that they are shuting down 


our mission is to provide education for 100% free we need to make sure one thing very clearly that 

we had many good opportunity to sell this entire project to gaint companies so that they can commercialize our vision of provide ai based education

We the team JupiLearning has strongly declared ourself Infront of those corporates that JupiLearning is now and in future provide free education for all since our repo has certain limitations for modifying and redistribution we want to make it clear that the license is what preventing our *our* vision to provide free education from the gaint companies from commercializing the ai based education

To Whom it may concern,

Even tho you guys had illegally cloned our project moreover didn't followed any ethics or gave us credit, even we had solid evidence based on the mail spoofing of certain hospitals in India which is very much sensitive and illegal (investigation is on progress by cyber security experts  ) 
https://archive.pib.gov.in/release02/lyr2002/rfeb2002/01022002/r010220022.html#:~:text=Whoever%20commits%20hacking%20shall%20be,Section%2066%20of%20the%20Act.
we Team JupiLearning wants to make remember one thing that ( we have started moving the investigation let you know that you are not fully anonymous in india with recent IT acts its easy to trace down certain attackers who are committing such  level Cybercrimes )

Our mission is to provide free education for all the students and for that it's very important to protect the project it's our project we are providing free education from the beginning and it will persist same. 

together our vision is to provide free education making the illegally cloned version of our site , claiming it as open jupi  and doing attacks against us is actually not making any sense since you claim your self as part of FOSS, FOSS is ment to support open source community we are transparent we are open.  the only restrictions we have is you need to legally get our authorisation to modify or make anychanges which is clearly mentioned on license and that's for protecting our vision from gaints for a better future 

Its our duty to protect such visionary projects from getting commercialized
